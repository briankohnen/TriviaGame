# TriviaGame
timed trivia game that I am making for class.

6 trivia questions based on video games.

The player has 30 seconds to answer the question, not answering is logged separately than an incorrect guess.

After each guess, 5 seconds pass before moving onto the next question.

The player's score is shown at the end of the six questions, and the option to start again becomes available.
